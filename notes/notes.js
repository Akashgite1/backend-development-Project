// starting a backend project 
// npm init -y for importing package.json file npm is node package manager 
// what is packge manager and its use 
//A package manager is a tool that helps you install, update, and manage software libraries (packages) easily.



//! Real-life Example
// Imagine you're setting up a new phone:
//     App Store/Play Store = Package Manager
//     Apps = Packages (e.g., WhatsApp, Instagram)
// Instead of downloading apps from random websites, you use the App Store to install, update, or delete apps safely. The App Store also ensures the apps are compatible with your phone.
// In Programming:
//     npm (JavaScript)
//     pip (Python)
//     composer (PHP)
//     apt (Linux)

// made the folder + file 
//  public/temp

// .gitkeep file is used to keep the folder in the git repo even if it is empty 
// since the git does not keep the empty folder in the repo 

//.gitignore file is used to ignore the files that we do not want to push to the git repo 
// for example node_modules folder is not pushed to the git repo 
// so we add node_modules in the .gitignore file 

// env file is used to keep the secret keys and passwords 
// we do not want to push the secret keys and passwords to the git repo 

// src file is used to keep the source code of the project 
// made the src folder 

// nodemon is used to run the server when we make changes in the code nodemon automatically restarts the server so we do not have to restart the server again and again  
// npm install nodemon --save-dev 

//! mkdir is used to make the folder 
// mkdir foldername 
// example mkdir src database
